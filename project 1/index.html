        <h2> This project illustrates the concept of <strong>html structuring</strong></h2>
        <p1>
            So far, I have learnt the following things:
            <ul>
                <li> How to <em>think like a programmer </em>, and how to ask for help when stuck! </li>
                <li> How the internet and web works</li>
                <li> Basics of git and github, and how to create a collaboration workflow </li>
                <li> The basics of setting up a linux development environment and bash scripting </li>
                <li> The basics of web technologies: html, css, and javascript </li>
            </ul>
        </p1>

        <p2>
            I hope and expect to get better with consistent practice and learning. However, here is my
            humble beginning!
            Cheers...
